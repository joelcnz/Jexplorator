Use ex screen. Going through the verses on vixploreJoel.bin [for vixplore.bin) (always going right, and up at each end). Use B in edit mode to show screen verse.

I'm not sure on the spelling of the name of this game.

settings.ini should be like: currentCampain=Campains/Explore

Need to define stuff better. bin files are buildings, campaigns are groups of levels, levels are things like; how much diamonds to collect (missions, really).

`git push`

eg ‘dub —-build=unittest’ or is it just `dub test`

To run the game:
./jex

Problems:
1. Pressed 'e' from play mode. And it crashed strait away.
	play
	play
	edit
	edit
	Bus error: 10
	$
2. While editing the program crashed. Save often.


Please read:
Don't save over test.bin. Run the game, load a level, use [P] to place players to save.

Looks like you have to run it from the terminal.

Steps:
Press [T] for terminal
Enter ‘cat’ for list of projects
Enter ‘l 1’ for arena level
Enter ’t’ to go out of the terminal
Click for full screen, can be faster
Press [E] and play

Mouse (edit):
P - place where the guys popup	
B - Select type of tile from mouse position. For paint brush (right click if you have a mouse plugged in - - the track pad doesn’t work)
V - Put current tile down at mouse cursor position
J - Jeep (add and remove)
LSystem + 1 for front painting layer
LSystem + 2 for normal painting layer
LSystem + 3 for back painting layer
W - wipe layers (dark brick for back layer)
G - count the number of tiles the cursor is over
Num1, Num2 & Num3 - choose which tile
LSystem + L - load current project
LSystem + S - save current project
E - toggle edit/play
LSystem + Return - reset level.

LSystem + esc to quit

t - for terminal

Guys:
Left player - A - left, D right, W - up (tap), S - down (tap)
Right player - Left - left, Right right, Up - up (tap), Down - down (tap) - - cursor keys
I’ve got less holding keys down to avoid key clashing, (a pro for multi computers).

Jerminal:
h - for help
cat - list projects
load # - load from cat list
save <file name> - save project
create # # - create a new project
t - quit terminal

Code:
		import std.algorithm;
		import std.range;
		g_bullits = g_bullits.filter!(a => a.bullitState != BullitState.dead).array;

		//foreach_reverse(i, bullit; g_bullits) {
		//	with(bullit) {
		//		process;
				//if (bullitState == BullitState.dead)
					//g_bullits.remove(i);
					//g_bullits = g_bullits[0 .. i] ~ g_bullits[i + 1 .. $];
		//	}
		//}
