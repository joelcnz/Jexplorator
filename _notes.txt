Trouble shooting \/

Use ex screen. Going through the verses on vixploreJoel.bin [for vixplore.bin) (always going right, and up at each end). Use B in edit mode to show screen verse.

I'm not sure on the spelling of the name of this game.

settings.ini should be like: currentBuildingFileName=./explore.bin

Need to define stuff better. bin files are buildings, campaigns are groups of levels, levels are things like; how much diamonds to collect (missions, really).

`git push`

eg ‘dub —-build=unittest’ or is it just `dub test`

To run the game:
./jex

Problems:


Please read:
Don't save over test.bin. Run the game, load a level, use [P] to place players to save.

Press [T] for terminal
Enter ‘cat’ for list of projects
Enter ‘l 1’ for arena level
Enter ’t’ to go out of the terminal
Click for full screen, can be faster
Press [command] + [E] and play

Mouse (edit):
S - Show verse(s), if any
LSystem + P - place where the guys popup (see key P)
B - Select type of tile from mouse position. For paint brush (right click if you have a mouse plugged in - - the track pad doesn’t work)
V - Put current tile down at mouse cursor position
J - Jeep (add and remove)
LSystem + 1 for front painting layer
LSystem + 2 for normal painting layer
LSystem + 3 for back painting layer
W - wipe layers (dark brick for back layer)
G - count the number of tiles the cursor is over
Num1, Num2 & Num3 - choose which tiles
LSystem + L - load current project
LSystem + S - save current project
E - toggle edit/play
LSystem + Return - start mission.
P - toggle between guys

LSystem + esc to quit

t - for terminal

Guys:
Left player - A - left, D right, W - up (tap), S - down (tap)
Right player - Left - left, Right right, Up - up (tap), Down - down (tap) - - cursor keys
I’ve got less holding keys down to avoid key clashing, (a pro for multi computers).

Jerminal:
h - for help
cat - list projects
load # - load from cat list
save <file name> - save project
create # # - create a new project
t - quit terminal

Code:
		import std.algorithm;
		import std.range;
		g_bullits = g_bullits.filter!(a => a.bullitState != BullitState.dead).array;

		//foreach_reverse(i, bullit; g_bullits) {
		//	with(bullit) {
		//		process;
				//if (bullitState == BullitState.dead)
					//g_bullits.remove(i);
					//g_bullits = g_bullits[0 .. i] ~ g_bullits[i + 1 .. $];
		//	}
		//}

19 8 2019 Issue: Jeeps overlapping
Solution: Place the jeeps from left to right. And not have more than two on the same plain

Issue: Delete with GUI not working!
Problem: You can't delete the current building file.
Solution: load a different building, then delete the old one.

Issue: Want to remove a verse ref
Solution: Just enter 'ref' in the j-terminal edit the current screen


Steps:
Jecsplorater:
1. Run program
2. Press 3 for campaigns
3. Pick campaign
4. For the password put in the password (put nothing for 1st mission, in which case - delete the artifact and press enter)
5. At the start use WASD and Z, hit space to start
6. Collect the said amount of diamonds (if any)
7. Get away in a rocket
8. Take note of the password for the next mission (if not last mission you've just completed)
9. If you don’t make it, you can try again by pressing [command] + [E] (for edit mode) and press [command] + [return] to start again
10. To go to next mission, press [command] + [A]
11. Repeat from step 2
